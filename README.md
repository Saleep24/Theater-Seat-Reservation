This guide walks you through setting up the project, contributing code, and collaborating effectively using GitHub. Let’s get started!

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
   First, download the project to your computer:


//Copy paste these on your terminal

git clone https://github.com/Saleep24/Theater-Seat-Reservation.git  
cd Theater-Seat-Reservation

2. Create a Branch for your feature
   I usually name my branch as MyName_feature (so whatever you’re comfortable with)

git checkout -b MyName_feature

3. Work on your Task
   Work on your task and test the changes on your computer

4. Save and Share your Changes
   Run these to push the new feature that you worked on your branch (remember not main branch!!!)
   Git add .
   Git commit -m “Your Name: Added <feature name>”
   Git push origin MyName_feature (Your branch name)
